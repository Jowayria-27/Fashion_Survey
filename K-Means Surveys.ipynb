            "De-incentives most definitely work, but i don’t fully believe it’s the most effective when it comes to fast fashion. I mean I can not speed for a minute and not take a ticket and pay a fine. But imposing taxes / regulations on a company and making things expensive for them, they can run around and find a hidden way to reduce their costs. It’s a capitalistic world after all. I think a change in companies’ attitude takes the win, or at least at first. A company will promote its products more than a person’s word of mouth will, and therefore they will put their ethicality out there, raising awareness and causing other competitors to follow the same ethical manners in order for them to not be left behind. It also needs to be said that that change will cause / is caused by a change in customer behavior. They’re quite interrelated, there’s a casual relationship. A company cannot afford to produce things consumers do not want anymore. I know we always look for one best way, but one can’t work anymore in this world.    2\n",
